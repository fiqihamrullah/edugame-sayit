This is for educational purpose for children to learn English. Learning materials are divided into many categories and 
there are 3 types of gameplay to be played and enjoyed by using google speech to text to answer the question provided in the game.

This is my old project (helped high-school student develop their own idea). I only recently started using Git as my portfolio.
